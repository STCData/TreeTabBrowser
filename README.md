# TreeTabBrowser

TreeTabBrowser is a powerful Swift library for creating embedded tabbed WKWebView-based SwiftUI widgets of a browser with hierarchical tabs and advanced features. This browser is designed to provide a seamless browsing experience with a focus on ease of use and advanced functionality.

## Features

TreeTabBrowser provides several unique features that make it stand out from other web browsers:

  - Hierarchical Tabs: You can organize tabs into a hierarchy for better management of your browsing sessions. With this feature, you can create multiple levels of nested tabs, which can be collapsed or expanded as needed.
  - Convenient APIs for Scraping: TreeTabBrowser makes it easy to extract content from the viewed pages. The convenient APIs for scraping allow you to extract text, images, and other data from the pages you visit.
  - Observing User Actions: With TreeTabBrowser, you can observe user actions such as clicks and page loads. This feature allows you to collect valuable data about user behavior and optimize your app accordingly.
  - Programmatic Automation of the Browser: TreeTabBrowser makes it easy to automate the browser using Swift code. You can use the APIs to navigate between pages, extract data, and perform other actions programmatically.


### Hierarchical Tabs

TreeTabBrowser's hierarchical tabs feature allows users to organize their browsing sessions more efficiently. Unlike traditional browsers that only allow a single layer of tabs, TreeTabBrowser enables users to create multiple levels of nested tabs, much like a tree structure.

This hierarchical organization of tabs makes it easy to group related tabs and keep them organized. For example, if you are working on a research project, you can create a top-level tab for the project and then create nested tabs for each topic or sub-topic. You can then collapse or expand these nested tabs as needed, making it easy to focus on a specific area of research or view the bigger picture.

Additionally, TreeTabBrowser's hierarchical tabs feature allows users to keep their browsing sessions organized and tidy, even when they have multiple tabs open. Users can easily move tabs around, drag them to different levels of the hierarchy, and rearrange them as needed. This feature makes it easy to manage complex browsing sessions, allowing users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

In summary, TreeTabBrowser's hierarchical tabs feature provides users with a powerful tool for organizing their browsing sessions. By allowing multiple levels of nested tabs and providing a flexible and intuitive interface, users can keep their browsing sessions organized and focused, even when they have dozens of tabs open.


### Convenient APIs for Scraping

APIs for scraping make it easy to extract content from web pages. This feature is particularly useful for developers and researchers who need to extract data from multiple web pages quickly and efficiently.

The APIs for scraping provided by TreeTabBrowser allow users to extract various types of content, including text, images, links, and HTML elements. These APIs are easy to use and provide a flexible interface for extracting data from web pages.

For example, a developer can use TreeTabBrowser's APIs to extract product information from an online store. They can write a script that navigates to the store's product pages, extracts the product name, description, price, and image, and stores the data in a database. This process can be automated, allowing the developer to extract data from hundreds or thousands of product pages quickly and efficiently.

Researchers can also use TreeTabBrowser's scraping APIs to collect data for their studies. For example, a researcher studying social media behavior can use the APIs to extract data from multiple social media sites, including user profiles, posts, and comments. This data can then be analyzed to gain insights into user behavior on social media.

In summary, TreeTabBrowser's convenient APIs for scraping make it easy to extract content from web pages. This feature is useful for developers, researchers, and anyone who needs to extract data from multiple web pages quickly and efficiently. With TreeTabBrowser's scraping APIs, users can automate the data extraction process, saving time and effort.

### Observing User Actions

user action observation feature allows developers and researchers to collect valuable data about user behavior on the web. With this feature, users can observe user actions such as clicks, page loads, and form submissions, and collect data on how users interact with web pages.

This feature is particularly useful for developers who are building web applications or websites. By observing user actions, developers can gain insights into how users interact with their applications and optimize them accordingly. For example, if a developer observes that users are frequently clicking on a particular button or link, they can make that button or link more prominent or move it to a more accessible location.

Researchers can also use TreeTabBrowser's user action observation feature to collect data for their studies. For example, a researcher studying the usability of a website can use the feature to observe how users interact with the site and identify areas for improvement.

TreeTabBrowser's user action observation feature is easy to use and provides a flexible interface for collecting data. Users can configure the feature to observe specific types of user actions, such as clicks or form submissions, and specify which data to collect. The collected data can then be exported for analysis or stored in a database for later use.

In summary, TreeTabBrowser's user action observation feature provides a powerful tool for collecting data on user behavior on the web. With this feature, developers and researchers can gain insights into how users interact with web pages and optimize their applications and studies accordingly.

### Programmatic Automation

TreeTabBrowser's programmatic automation of the browser feature allows developers to automate the browser's behavior using Swift code. This feature is useful for developers who need to perform repetitive tasks, such as navigating between web pages, extracting data, or submitting forms.

Using TreeTabBrowser's programmatic automation APIs, developers can write scripts that automate these tasks, saving time and effort. For example, a developer can write a script that logs into a website, navigates to a specific page, fills out a form, and submits it. This process can be automated, allowing the developer to repeat the task multiple times without manual intervention.

TreeTabBrowser's programmatic automation feature is also useful for testing web applications. Developers can write scripts that simulate user behavior, such as clicking on buttons, filling out forms, and submitting data. These scripts can be used to test the application's functionality and identify any bugs or issues.

TreeTabBrowser's programmatic automation APIs are easy to use and provide a flexible interface for automating the browser's behavior. Developers can configure the APIs to perform specific tasks, such as navigating to a specific URL, clicking on a button, or extracting data from a web page.

In summary, TreeTabBrowser's programmatic automation of the browser feature provides developers with a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks and testing web applications. With the feature's flexible APIs and easy-to-use interface, developers can write scripts that automate complex tasks, saving time and effort.





## Integration with GPT and other ML

The end goal of TreeTabBrowser is to provide deep integration with GPT and other machine learning technologies. With the advanced scraping and automation features provided by TreeTabBrowser, it is possible to extract and analyze large amounts of data from the web. This data can then be used to train and improve machine learning models, resulting in more accurate and useful predictions.
